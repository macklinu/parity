As of version 1.0.0, Parity no longer distributes its executables via Rubygems.

If you use apt or Homebrew to install dependencies, you can install Parity
through those package managers to get the `development`, `staging`, and
`production` executables. Installing the executables via package manager makes
the programs available across Ruby versions.

Users without access to those package managers or who prefer to self-install can
find the executables at our Github repository:
